# DiscordVerifySchulich

This is a discord bot used on the official Schulich Leader discord server, which is the hub for collaboration and discussion amongst Schulich Leader scholars.

Before this bot, we had a verification channel in which new users had to write out their identity in the form of NAME, UNIVERSITY, OFFICIAL PROGRAM, AWARD YEAR. Such as: Anthony Galassi, Queen's University, Computing, 2019. From this point a server admin would have to cross reference with the official Schulich Leader website to verify their identity to allow them access into the server.

The purpose of this bot is to automate this process previously done by server admins. David Goodman, the Vice President of the Schulich Foundation provided a .csv file with all current Schulich Leaders (including program alumni) for the purpose of this project. The maintenance plan is to update this .csv file every June once all incoming Schulich Leaders have been confirmed by the partner universities to allow access onto the official server. In essence, this bot will reduce ongoing verification work by the server admin team through automation of these processes and make it easily maintainable into the future of the official Schulich Leader discord server.
